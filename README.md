# codeys_counting

This is a project from my Code Academy course! It is a game that uses [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/)

The game draws inspiration from a game used to study chimpanzee memory. The premise of the game is that numbers flash on the screen for a brief period of time before being covered by circles. The goal is to then click on the circles in the correct order from smallest to largest.
